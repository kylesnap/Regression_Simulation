# Regression_Simulation
Simulations of estimators for regression models by Kyle Dewsnap.

Originally a simulation of the OLS estimator for simple linear regression models. 

Use `python3 main.py` in terminal to run simulation. Note: requires package dependencies to run, including tkinter, scipy, and numpy. Please install these if prompted before posting an issue.
